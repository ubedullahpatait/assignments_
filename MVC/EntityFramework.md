**Entity Framework**
 
Entity framework is an Object Relational Mapping (ORM) framework that offers an automated mechanism to developers for storing and accessing the data in the database. This tutorial covers the features of Entity Framework using Code First approach. It also explains the new features introduced in Entity Framework 6.

The Database First Approach provides an alternative to the Code First and Model First approaches to the Entity Data Model. It creates model codes (classes, properties, DbContext etc.) from the database in the project and those classes become the link between the database and controller.
