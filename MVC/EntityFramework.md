**Entity Framework**
 
Entity framework (hereafter, EF) is the framework ORM (object-relational mapping) that Microsoft makes available as part of the .NET development (version 3.5 SP1 and later). Its purpose is to abstract the ties to a relational database, in such a way that the developer can relate to the database entity as to a set of objects and then to classes in addition to their properties. In essence, we speak about decoupling between our Applications and the logic of data access, which proves to be a major plus. For example: If we need to move - in the context of a single program - to different manufacturers database, it would be required to review the way and the instructions with which we interface the data manager on duty.
