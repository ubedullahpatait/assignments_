# Differences Between .NET Core and .NET Framework
| .Net Core | .Net Framework |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| .Net Core is an open source. | Certain components of the .Net Framework are open source. |
| Works on the principle of “build once, run anywhere”. It is compatible with various operating systems — Windows, Linux, and Mac OS as it is cross-platform.  |.NET Framework is compatible with the windows operating system. Although, it was developed to support software and applications on all operating systems.  |
|.Net Core does not support desktop application development and it rather focuses on the web, windows mobile, and windows store. | .Net Framework is used for the development of both desktop and web applications as well as it supports windows forms and WPF applications.|
|.NET Core is packaged and installed independently of the underlying operating system as it is cross-platform|.NET Framework is installed as a single package for Windows operating system.|
| .NET Core offers high performance and scalability.|.Net Framework is less effective in comparison to .Net Core in terms of performance and scalability of applications|
|.NET Core is compatible with various operating systems — Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.|.NET Framework is compatible only with the Windows operating system.|
|.NET Core provides light-weight editors and command-line tools for all supported platforms.|.Net Framework is heavy for Command Line Interface and developers prefer to work on the lightweight Command Line Interface.|

# Difference Between ASP.NET MVC And ASP.NET Core

| ASP.NET MVC|ASP.NET Core MVC  |

|In ASP.NET MVC 5/4 or classic ASPX based applications, we use separate DI containers like Unity, AutoFac, StructureMap, etc. We had to build up our project to use DI, its additional effort.|Now in ASP.NET Core applications, Just create some services and get ready to use DI. |

# Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) 
The full name of CORS is Cross Origin Resource Sharing. It is a W3C standard that allows a server to make cross-domain calls from the specified domains, while rejecting others By default due to browser security it prevents a web page from making one domain Ajax request to another domain.

CORS support in ASP.NET Web API. We'll start by creating two ASP.NET projects – one called "WebService", which hosts a Web API controller, and the other called "WebClient", which calls WebService. Because the two applications are hosted at different domains, an AJAX request from WebClient to WebService is a cross-origin request.
