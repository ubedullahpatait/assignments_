# Differences Between .NET Core and .NET Framework
| .Net Core | .Net Framework |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| .Net Core is an open source. | Certain components of the .Net Framework are open source. |
| Works on the principle of “build once, run anywhere”. It is compatible with various operating systems — Windows, Linux, and Mac OS as it is cross-platform.  |.NET Framework is compatible with the windows operating system. Although, it was developed to support software and applications on all operating systems.  |
|.Net Core does not support desktop application development and it rather focuses on the web, windows mobile, and windows store. | .Net Framework is used for the development of both desktop and web applications as well as it supports windows forms and WPF applications.|
|.NET Core is packaged and installed independently of the underlying operating system as it is cross-platform|.NET Framework is installed as a single package for Windows operating system.|
| .NET Core offers high performance and scalability.|.Net Framework is less effective in comparison to .Net Core in terms of performance and scalability of applications|
|.NET Core is compatible with various operating systems — Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.|.NET Framework is compatible only with the Windows operating system.|
|.NET Core provides light-weight editors and command-line tools for all supported platforms.|.Net Framework is heavy for Command Line Interface and developers prefer to work on the lightweight Command Line Interface.|

# Difference Between ASP.NET MVC And ASP.NET Core

| ASP.NET MVC|ASP.NET Core MVC  |
|----|----|
|ASP.NET framework is a highly testable and powerful framework. It's a web form based framework. You can create applications in ASP.NET (.aspx) or Razor page. MVC has three major parts - Model, View and Controller.|ASP.NET Core is a "learn and compose" based framework to develop an application. It mainly focuses on fully open source. You can develop  ASP.NET Core easily.|
|ASP.NET MVC gives you a pattern-based way to develop dynamic websites and applications. It has many features and powerful tools. You can learn MVC and easily working with Routing, UI, Layout, Theme, data, API, and others.|ASP.NET Core also focuses on another region. It's cross platform, which means you can use it on Windows, Mac or Linux. The previous version ASP.NET MVC was not cross-platform and worked only on Windows. |

# Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) 
is a standard that allows a server to relax the same-origin policy. Using CORS, a server can explicitly allow some cross-origin requests while rejecting others. CORS is safer and more flexible than earlier techniques such as JSONP. This tutorial shows how to enable CORS in your Web API application.

CORS support in ASP.NET Web API. We'll start by creating two ASP.NET projects – one called "WebService", which hosts a Web API controller, and the other called "WebClient", which calls WebService. Because the two applications are hosted at different domains, an AJAX request from WebClient to WebService is a cross-origin request.
